Project 1 --> Movie Recommendation System
Dataset used --> [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)
Approach --> Built a content based recommendation system. There are 2 datasets,one is movies and one is credits I merged them into one large dataset then analysed each column and only kept those columns which were useful for content based tagging.After selecting the columns I cleaned the data removed duplicated and NaN values . Then as the data was in dictonary and i wanted it to be in list i converted all of columns in list and i removed the white space from every word as it will not confuse our model of someone has same first name.Now i had my data ready for model building then i vectorised every row using scikit learn count vectorisation and after vectorisation there were many words which were repetetive i performed stemming and them simply merged every column in one single column named tags where i was going to remove the similarity score of every vector(movie) i used cosine distance not eucledian distance.then after removing similarity score i simply created a function named recommend which takes movie name as input and with help of its index it will remove its similarity score array and then i sorted the array in descending fashion which gave me the top similar movie indexes then i simply fetched top 5 movies titles using iloc
